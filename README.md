# Snake Game
This project was implemented for the requirements of the Autonomous Agents course, taught by Prof. M. Lagoudakis in Fall 2019-20 at the ECE School of TUC.
This project is an attempt of building an agent capable of playing the classic Snake Game. Goal of this project is to control the snake efficiently so it can achieve the maximum score possible. This game can be considered as a maze solving game or path finding.
Two algorithms have been used in this project. The A* Algorithm is a well known path finding algorithm used in multiple applications. It is very efficient and so it constitutes the first approach. The second algorithm is based on Reinforcement Learning approach. The Q Learning algorithm can be used from agents for discovering opportunities and difficulties on run time.
